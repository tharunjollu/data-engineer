# Data Engineer: Coding Exercise

This is a coding exercise to help us assess candidates looking to join the Data Science & Engineering team at Cond√© Nast.

The test is intended to be completed at home, unattended, within 48 hours.
While it is expected that you will complete all of the required questions, if you find you aren't able to fully complete the exercise or you get stuck, please send us as much as you have done and we will evaluate accordingly. Pseudo-code or pseudologic for incomplete questions is expected and will help us better understand your approach.
We look forward to talking about your experiences.

We understand that your time is valuable, and appreciate any time that you contribute towards building a strong team here.
If you really cannot spare the time, you may want to take a look at Option 2.

## Option 1

Build a pipeline to extract the data from the `data` folder and ensure you have performed basic exploration data analysis on the data to ensure the data is ready to be used for transformations.

Within the same pipeline, build the following transformations, aggregations and data subsets:
 - What was the average time each driver spent at the pit stop for any given race?
 - Insert the missing code (e.g: ALO for Alonso) for all drivers
 - Select a season from the data and determine who was the youngest and oldest at the start of the season and the end of the season
 - Which driver has the most wins and which driver has the most losses for each Grand Prix?

The pipeline should write to a CSV file following each transformation step.

**Optional Bonus Question**

If we asked you to attempt to "predict" or "score" who would be
the most likely winner of a race on a particular track, how would you attempt to solve this question (please
include any clarifying questions you may have)?

Feel free to answer the optional question directly within a text file, or where ever
you feel comfortable, and we can access the answer.

Although the data files are small, your pipeline should be designed such that it could be scalable.

It is totally permitted to make use of any sample code, libraries or other resources available on the internet. Directly copying someone else's answer to this exact question is not advisable.

**Pro Tip** see the `examples` directory for an example script using `PySpark` (we're a `PySpark` shop)
therefore, using `PySpark` successfully will yield you bonus points.

## Option 2

If you have some personal code, or open source contribution, that you would be prepared to share with us, we can assess that instead.  The code should meet the following criteria:

- It should be at least 1-2 hours of your own work
- Ideally, it should involve an element of data processing
- It should demonstrate how you approach a problem
- It should be something that you are able to discuss with us

# Delivery

You can submit your code however you want - send the details to your point of contact.  
Please include a README containing your thoughts, and any setup instructions (if applicable) and keep the setup steps simple.

Please ensure you do not include any confidential information.
