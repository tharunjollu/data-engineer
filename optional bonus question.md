# Race Winner Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict or score the most likely winner of a race on a particular track using machine learning models trained on historical race data. The pipeline involves data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Pipeline Steps

### 1. Data Preparation

- Clean, transform, and aggregate historical race data.
- Create features such as:
  - Average time spent at pit stops for each driver
  - Average finishing position for each driver on the track
  - Average number of pit stops for each driver on the track
  - Average lap time for each driver on the track
  - Total number of wins, podiums, and points for each driver
  - Total number of retirements and DNFs for each driver
  - Car performance metrics (e.g., horsepower, weight, aerodynamics)
  - Track characteristics (e.g., length, number of turns, elevation changes)

### 2. Feature Engineering

- Utilize domain knowledge to create new features.
- Example: Create a feature representing the difference in lap time between a driver and the fastest driver on the track.

### 3. Model Selection

- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Neural Networks

### 4. Model Training

- Split data into training and validation sets.
- Use training set for model training.
- Apply techniques like cross-validation to prevent overfitting.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- Use the validation set to evaluate model performance.
- Metrics for evaluation:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score

### 6. Model Deployment

- Deploy the trained model to a production environment.
- Use cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure for deployment.
- Integrate the model into a system to predict race winners on a specific track.

## Clarifying Questions

Before implementing the pipeline, consider the following questions:

- What is the format of the data files?
- What is the time frame of the historical race data?
- What are the specific requirements for the machine learning model?
- What are the constraints on the pipeline's scalability?

## Tools and Technologies

- Apache Spark
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow
- Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)

## Usage

To use this pipeline:
1. Prepare the historical race data in the specified format.
2. Modify the feature engineering and model selection steps based on requirements.
3. Train and evaluate the model using the provided tools.
4. Deploy the model to chosen cloud platform for production use.
